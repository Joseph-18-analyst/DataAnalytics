Countries world-wide organize football/soccer leagues the duration of which could even be a whole year. More often than not each alliance plays with 20 odd groups chosen from the level divisions and they compete against each other. Matches could either be domestic i.e. home or away and the outcome could be broadly classified as – home win, away win or draw.
Three of the most popular, historically and statistically significant, and widely followed leagues are the English Premier League (EPL), the Spanish La Liga and the French Le Championate. But its fan following does not end within these boundaries and is span across the world with thousands of registered fan clubs having millions of members.
No wonder why the betting agencies and masters of the game spend millions on the analyses of each game given such a huge fan base going gaga over the tournament. It is this analysis of the game statistics that helps not only in better profits of the betting companies, but also focus on improvement of the team formation, player ratings and also for the transfer windows. Most connoisseurs too follow the statistics for discussions happening in sport shows which indeed have immense viewership.
The concept of statistics into sports has been well received irrespective of genre. What followed is the formulation of analysis and predictive capacities alongside which was motivated by the gaining importance of team building. It would help the team managements to formulate strategies once they have an insight of the opponent's tactics which would let them line up with a possible team to tackle. It would make a difference in acquiring potential resources in the transfer market. Alternately the betting companies and reviewers are also spending lots on this to make things interesting and profitable for the fans who would be interested in the forecast beforehand.
By this project, the primary questions we are trying to raise are:

•	Can we predict the outcome of EPL, Le Championnat and La Liga matches?
•	If we can do the above, how accurate are our results?
